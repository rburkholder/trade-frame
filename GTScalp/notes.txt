Calculate average positive, average positive maximum
Calculate average negative, average negative maximum
Use as trading range for getting in and getting out locations
Pivots will also be useful on this
Calculate how often open/close are at high/low levels
Calculate typical close-open and high-low ranges



IQFeedRetrieval needs a singleton IQFeed

plugins, like Smartquant: http://www.ddj.com/cpp/204202899




Compression:
http://www.zlib.net/
http://datacompression.info/sourcecode.shtml

build snmp trend system to prototype traffic analysis
pc based with multicast then web based with multicast
which would be example of multiclient capabilities


Create quote/trade playback capability
Will require storage for this first.

ARMS index
incremental bar update with each trade, but maximum once per second

CBar, CTrade, CQuote usage:
always delete at source, if something keeps it, they need to make a new copy
fix with suitable use of pointers and constant references

Need to add profit/loss indicators on trade frame
Need to add various indicators to trade frame

Need to back feed TradeFrame with quote/trades

Need to bring in DateTime from IQFeed/Genesis to indicate start of trading day

Market Depth Indicator (side by side bid/ask)
Ticker Tape

add opening price, pivots, zig zag, bollinger to trade frame

need to abstract the obtaining of data, much like SQ QD

Save window locations
---
Bid/Ask Color & breakdown on trade frame
market profile
market delta price indicators
volume@price vertical chart
queue up 9100 stats objects to be reused
anything else to back fill?
arms
store values to disk

   * The Ensign Windows Level II screen can be sorted by Total Bid/Ask Volume.  
   * This shows who is active and leading the market.  
   * It also counts how many times each Market Maker presented the LEAD bid or ask.  
   * It also displays ratios on bid and ask LEAD counts when a Market Maker is selected.  
   * By the way, there are some very interesting patterns formed while CHARTING the two top Market Makers 
   * (on the same Chart) which may tip-off the direction of the market for the next several minutes.  
   * Great for Scalpers or the Market Makers themselves.
